## 📘 Project Overview  
This project simulates a real-world analytics engagement with the **State of Massachusetts Department of Education**. The goal was to help the Superintendent and school board understand the performance of schools across the state and identify key areas for improvement.

Using **real 2017 MA DOE data**, I analyzed **1,861 schools** and **953,000+ students** to uncover trends in:
- ✅ Graduation rates  
- ✅ College attendance  
- ✅ Class sizes  
- ✅ 4th grade math performance  
- ✅ District-level strengths and weaknesses  

The final outcome is a fully interactive **Tableau dashboard** summarizing the state of Massachusetts education.

## 🎯 Key Questions Addressed  
### **1️⃣ What are the bottom high schools by graduation rate?**  
A bar chart highlights the lowest-performing high schools, allowing leadership to focus improvement efforts.

### **2️⃣ How does class size affect college attendance?**  
A scatter plot (with trendline & economic disadvantage coloring) examines the relationship between average class size and the percentage of students attending college.

### **3️⃣ Which districts excel the most in 4th-grade math?**  
A line chart shows which districts exceed the Superintendent’s target threshold of **50% P+A (Proficient + Advanced)**.

### **4️⃣ What are the overall statewide metrics?**  
KPI/BAN indicators summarize:  
- Total number of schools  
- Total number of students
